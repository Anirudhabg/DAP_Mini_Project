# FeatherGuard: Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
FeatherGuard is a dynamic Python project aimed at increasing public awareness and spreading knowledge about bird species. It is constructed using the Flask framework and utilizes a dataset comprising 200 birds, each with unique characteristics such as name, ID, conservation status, and more. The project has several goals:

- **Education and Awareness:** The initiative seeks to raise public awareness of the value of protecting endangered species and the necessity of bird conservation by providing thorough information about avian species.
  
- **Visualization:** Information regarding bird species may be quickly accessed and visualized by users thanks to an intuitive web interface. Investigating specifics like geographic range, migration trends, and taxonomy classifications is part of this.

- **Interactive Search:** This useful feature of the system lets users search for birds using keywords or their names, making it easier for even the least knowledgeable users to find pertinent information.

## Features
- **Web Interface:** FeatherGuard provides an intuitive web interface for users to interact with the bird dataset.
  
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for birds using keywords or their names, enabling quick access to relevant information.
  
- **Educational Graphs:** The interface includes graphical representations in addition to textual data, including three educational graphs showing the conservation status, migration trends, and family classifications of the requested bird species.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application by executing `python app.py` in your terminal.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access FeatherGuard.
5. Use the search functionality or browse the available bird species to explore the dataset and visualize bird information.
